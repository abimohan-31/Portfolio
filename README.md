# Abi Mohan - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a Full Stack Web Developer. It is built with clean, semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3, focusing on a responsive and premium design.

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio serves as a central hub to demonstrate my technical proficiency and design capabilities. It features a unique angled hero section, floating project cards, a categorized skills area, and a dedicated contact form.

## ✨ Features

-   **Modern & Responsive Design**: A fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Angled Hero Section**: A visually striking introduction with a custom clip-path design.
-   **Floating Project Cards**: deeply interactive cards showcasing my top projects (WorkBond, Show Tracker, ToDo App).
-   **Skills Categorization**: clearly organized technical skills into Frontend, Backend, Tools, and UI/UX.
-   **Contact Form**: A functional-looking contact page (`contact.html`) linked from the homepage.
-   **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions for a polished user experience.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
-   **CSS3**: Custom styling with CSS Variables (Custom Properties), Flexbox, and Grid. No external CSS frameworks were used to ensure a lightweight and custom look.
-   **Google Fonts**: Typography powered by 'Inter' and 'Poppins' for a clean, professional aesthetic.
